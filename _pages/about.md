Hi, I'm Charan — a front-end developer who ships responsive, accessible user interfaces for the web. I build React and Next.js experiences that balance beautiful presentation with measurable performance improvements. I've delivered product features used by 10K+ people, introduced component systems for faster iteration, and kept releases predictable with CI/CD automation.

I love taking complex product requirements and distilling them into intuitive interactions. Recent wins include improving API-driven data views for 3D medical models, designing mobile-ready task flows, and cutting load times by up to 50% through thoughtful caching and pagination. When I'm not iterating on UI polish, you'll find me prototyping accessibility tests across devices or exploring creative AI tooling for storytellers.

Core focus areas
======
* **Production-grade React/Next.js** — Server Components, App Router, Server Actions, TanStack Query, and testing resilient UI flows.
* **Performance and accessibility** — Profiling bundle size, optimizing data fetching, and ensuring AA+ experiences across devices.
* **Product collaboration** — Partnering with designers, PMs, and QA to deliver polished UI, backed by telemetry and user testing.

Currently
------
* **UI/UX Developer Intern @ Neuron 3D** — building interactive controls for complex 3D model workflows, improving data fetching speed, and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
* Exploring junior front-end roles where I can continue crafting delightful, performant interfaces.

Let's work together
