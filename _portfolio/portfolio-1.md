Built a full-stack hiring tracker in Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript that keeps job searches organized from Saved → Applied → Screen → Interview → Offer/Rejected.

* Designed responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS and accessible keyboard shortcuts for quick updates.
* Implemented Server Actions for create/update flows, enabling optimistic UI with instant TanStack Query cache updates.
* Added CSV export/import, filter presets, and local persistence for view preferences to keep data portable.
* Theming system supports light/dark mode while maintaining WCAG AA contrast.
